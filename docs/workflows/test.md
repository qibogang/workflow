# `test.yml`

The workflow runs the tests and the documentation examples of the packages managed by poetry.
It also can evaluate the coverage and update codecov.

If dependabot is present in the repo and the `codecov_token` is used, this could generate [issues](https://github.com/qiboteam/qibocal/pull/238), since dependabot has no access to the repo secrets.

For public repos, the `codecov_token` is not [required](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/frequently-asked-questions/#where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found), otherwise see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot) to enable the access.
